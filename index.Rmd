Hello! My name is Jaisal Amin and I’m a second-year Master’s student in Biostatistics at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. Prior to coming to Columbia, I studied at North Carolina State University and worked 

I am interested in using data and sound statistical methods to solve real-world problems. Outside the classroom, I enjoy perfecting my piano-playing skills and spending quality time with friends and family.

If you're interested, you can view my resume [here](about.html), as well as some projects I have worked on [here](./flexdash/flexdashboard.html).

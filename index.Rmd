Hello! My name is Jaisal Amin and I’m a second-year Master’s student in Biostatistics at Columbia University. In addition to being a full-time student, I am also currently a teaching assistant and research intern at NYU Langone Health. Prior to coming to Columbia, I studied at North Carolina State University and worked in various research roles.

I am interested in using data and sound statistical methods to solve real-world problems. Outside the classroom, I enjoy perfecting my piano-playing skills and spending quality time with friends and family.

I keep this site updated with my latest projects and information, please feel free to check out my work or contact me with any inquiries!

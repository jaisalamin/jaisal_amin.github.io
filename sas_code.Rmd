/* (B) Using loops and arrays for missing observations and unit changes; */

* (C) Generating summary tables and graphs;

%macro summary (var);
proc tabulate data = gestation;
	class mrace drace;
	var gestation &var;
	table gestation*(mean*f=7.1 stddev*f=5.2) &var*(mean*f=7.1 stddev*f=5.2),

	density &var / type = normal;
run;

proc sgplot data = gestation;
	vbox &var / category = drace;
	xaxis label = "Father's race";
run;
%mend summary;

%summary(wt);

* (D) Hypothesis testing (using different dataset)

* i. Is there a difference in mean type-A personality score depending on family history?
* Checking normality assumption;

proc univariate data = chd normal;
	class Famhist;
	var TypeA;
run;

* Shapiro-Wilk p-value;
* (absent) 0.0175 (present) 0.3693: Reject H0;
* -> Assuming normality is not appropriate;

proc npar1way data = chd wilcoxon;
	class Famhist;
	var TypeA;
run;

* Equality of variances : p-value = 0.6548;
* Fail to reject H0 -> Use pooled variance;


* Is the Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient of alcohol and tobacco consumption equal to 0? ;

proc corr data = chd;
	var Alcohol Tobacco;
run;

* Is the proportion of having family history greater than 40%? ;

proc sort data = chd out = chd2; 
	by descending Famhist; 
run;
proc freq data = chd2 order = data;
	table Famhist / binomial (p = .4); * H0: p=0.4;
run;


* (E) Logistic regression model;

/* Binomial distribution / Logit link ;

proc genmod data = chd;
	model chd = Alcohol Tobacco
			/ dist = bin link = logit;
run;

/* Model selection ; */
proc logistic data = chd plots(only)=(roc effect);
	model chd = Alcohol Tobacco 
			/ lackfit outroc = roc selection = stepwise;
run;

proc logistic data = chd plots(only)=(roc effect);
	model chd (event = "Case") = Tobacco / lackfit outroc = roc;
run;
